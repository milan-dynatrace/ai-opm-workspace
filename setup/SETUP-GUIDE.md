# Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions to get your AI PM Workspace running.

## Prerequisites

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) installed
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- A Claude API key or Claude Pro/Max subscription
- Git

## Step 1: Clone and Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleksander-dytko/ai-pm-workspace.git
cd ai-pm-workspace
```

Open this folder as an Obsidian vault:
1. Open Obsidian
2. Click "Open folder as vault"
3. Select the `ai-pm-workspace` folder

## Step 2: Configure MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers let Claude Code connect to external tools. Configure the ones you use:

### GitHub (recommended)

```bash
claude mcp add github --transport streamable-http --url https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp
```

See [mcp-configs/github.md](mcp-configs/github.md) for detailed setup.

### Other MCPs (optional)

You can add any MCP server that enhances your workflow:
- **Notion**: For personal notes integration
- **Domain-specific docs**: For product documentation lookup (e.g., your company's docs)
- **Linear/Jira**: For issue tracking (if you don't use GitHub Issues)

Browse available MCPs at [mcp.so](https://mcp.so) or the [MCP servers directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Step 3: Run Personalization

Open Claude Code in this directory and run:

```
/personalize
```

This interactive skill will:
- Ask about your role, company, and product area
- Configure CLAUDE.md with your context
- Create stakeholder profiles (optional)

## Step 4: Start Using

Try these skills:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/today` | Plan your day (morning ritual) |
| `/meeting` | Process raw meeting notes into structured notes |
| `/decision [topic]` | Make a documented decision |
| `/communicate [topic + audience]` | Draft a Slack/email message |

## Step 5: Build Your Workflow

The included skills are a starting point. You can:

1. **Modify existing skills** - Edit files in `.claude/skills/` to match your workflow
2. **Create new skills** - Add a new folder in `.claude/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file
3. **Add MCP integrations** - Connect more tools via MCP servers
4. **Extend CLAUDE.md** - Add more context as your usage matures

### Skill ideas to build yourself

- **`/weekly-plan`**: Sunday/Monday weekly planning with P-Tasks
  - Review last week's completion rate
  - Analyze calendar for upcoming deadlines
  - Challenge overplanning (if >7 P-tasks, push back)
  - Create tasks with subtasks

- **`/initiative`**: Track product initiatives
  - Read status from external repos
  - Update working files in your vault
  - Cross-reference with meeting notes

- **`/reflect`**: Monthly personal reflection (as an agent, not a skill)
  - Analyze mood/energy patterns from daily journals
  - Identify recurring themes and burnout signals
  - Privacy-bounded: only reads personal content

```

**Obsidian** = your persistent knowledge base (Markdown files)
**Claude Code** = the executor that reads your vault and acts on it
**MCP** = bridges to external tools (GitHub, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code can't find my files
- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory
- Check that file paths in CLAUDE.md match your actual folder structure

### Skills not showing up
- Skills must be in `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
- The SKILL.md file needs valid frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Restart Claude Code after adding new skills
